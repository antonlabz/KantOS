# About

KantOS is a theme ported for OnionOS, which is inspired by the Kanto region of Pokémon. It was built using a combination of custom and original sprites from the GBA Pokémon games.

The concept design was first created by [Tressley on muOS](https://github.com/Tressley/KantOS/tree/main) for the Anbernic handheld devices. I was a huge fan of it, and I'd like to express my appreciation to Tressley for creating the theme and also giving me permission to port it to OnionOS.

I have since heavily modified it to suit the vastly-different OnionOS architecture, and have included many of my own additions to the theme.

# Credits

- *Aemiii91* for letting me include their `Dot-art by Yoshi-kun` icon pack on the official [Onion Theme Repo](https://github.com/OnionUI/Themes/blob/main/generated/icons_standalone/index.md)
- [Spriters-Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com) for the Pokémon sprites
- [Yuji Oshimoto](http://www.04.jp.org/) for the `04b_03` font
- Pokémon Black/White 2 for the Virbank City OST

# Important Notes

- It is ***highly*** recommended to update your OnionOS to at least `v4.3.1-1` or higher, as it removes the text-shadow effect that's present on earlier versions which is incompatible with the font used here (see the [OnionOS Releases page](https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion/releases) or use the OTA feature within the Apps on your Miyoo Mini)
- Font color of the highlighted item on the WIFI configuration page, as well as the font in the keyboard pop-up when entering a WIFI password is currently *bugged* since those are set at the system-level and isn't something I can change
- **In case you have any theme overrides set**, I recommend that you enable the `battery percentage` option for best UI experience if not already enabled (via `Apps > Tweaks > Appearance > Theme overrides > Battery Percentage` & set to Visible)
