Installing this theme on it's own will install the default appearance.

To get the alt version of the theme with the overworld icons (as seen in alt-preview.gif):
- copy the images inside the 'alt-skin' folder
- paste them into the 'skin' folder, replacing the existing ones
- install the theme as normal
